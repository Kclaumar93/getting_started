Laserâ€“plasma accelerators promise compact high-energy beams, but shot-to-shot stability remains a key challenge. Variations in laser parameters lead to fluctuations in the laser-plasma interaction, which in turn drive parameter jitters in the accelerated electron bunch. In this exercise, you will investigate how laser parameters correlate with output electron parameters.
Your primary objective is to identify and explain the source of shot-to-shot variations of the electron beam energy. Feel free to explore the dataset in any other way, e.g., try to predict the electron properties from the laser data or forcast the next shot's laser parameters based on the previous ones.
